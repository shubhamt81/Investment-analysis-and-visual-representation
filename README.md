# Investment-analysis-and-visual-representation
## Introduction
With ever-increasing inflation and never foreseen geopolitical conflicts, it is the need of the day to be financially stable and have investments. Every person has understood without properly channeling their wealth, they can lose a lot just by inflation. Institutes have been working on bringing more and more schemes and funds to attract retail investors. Mutual funds have captured the market by a large. They work on the basic principle that a fund manager will pool money from investors and invest the lump sum into various shares of companies that will perform well as per the knowledge of the fund manager. For this, they charge a small percentage of profits as a fee. There are many types of mutual funds out there categorizing from the types of stocks they invest to the minimum investable amount.
The market is flooded with various types of equity funds, debt funds, and hybrid funds. But the retail investor has barely any time and knowledge to dig deep into the financial aspects of every fund that is out there and understand which best suits the requirement. It is crucial to query this issue and provide retail investors with a solution that will help them to get the best fund for their requirements and have a visual representation and a brief analysis of the fund.
## Abstract
An investment is an asset or item acquired with the goal of generating income or appreciation. Mutual funds are an easy way to start with investment and work for financial stability. Our platform provides a solution to encourage more and more investors to begin investing. We approach this by suggesting the best fund for investors' requirements by comparing various parameters of the fund. It also gives a brief analysis and a visual representation which would help the investor get a glance at the fund and its parameters. The analysis contains a short easily understandable summary of complex parameters related to the fund and visual representation gives a peek at how the fund has performed in past.

## Technologies used
1) Srappy<br>
2) MySQL<br>
3) Flask<br>
4) Python<br>
5) React.js<br>
6) HTML<br>
7) JavaScript

## Javascript
JavaScript is a lightweight, cross-platform, and interpreted compiled programming language which is also known as the scripting language for webpages. It is well-known for the development of web pages, many non-browser environments also use it. JavaScript can be used for Client-side developments as well as Server-side developments. Javascript is both imperative and declarative type of language. JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, like Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements like operators, control structures, and statements.

## MySQL

MySQL is an Oracle-backed open source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on Structured Query Language (SQL). MySQL runs on virtually all platforms, including Linux, UNIX and Windows. Although it can be used in a wide range of applications, MySQL is most often associated with web applications and online publishing.

MySQL is an important component of an open source enterprise stack called LAMP. LAMP is a web development platform that uses Linux as the operating system, Apache as the web server, MySQL as the relational database management system and PHP as the object-oriented scripting language. (Sometimes Perl or Python is used instead of PHP.)

Originally conceived by the Swedish company MySQL AB, MySQL was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2008 and then by Oracle when it bought Sun in 2010. Developers can use MySQL under the GNU General Public License (GPL), but enterprises must obtain a commercial license from Oracle.

Today, MySQL is the RDBMS behind many of the top websites in the world and countless corporate and consumer-facing web-based applications, including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube.

### How MySQL works
MySQL is based on a client-server model. The core of MySQL is MySQL server, which handles all of the database instructions (or commands). MySQL server is available as a separate program for use in a client-server networked environment and as a library that can be embedded (or linked) into separate applications.

MySQL operates along with several utility programs which support the administration of MySQL databases. Commands are sent to MySQLServer via the MySQL client, which is installed on a computer.

MySQL was originally developed to handle large databases quickly. Although MySQL is typically installed on only one machine, it is able to send the database to multiple locations, as users are able to access it via different MySQL client interfaces. These interfaces send SQL statements to the server and then display the results.

## Flask
### What is Flask?
Flask is an API of Python that allows us to build up web-applications. It was developed by Armin Ronacher. Flask’s framework is more explicit than Django’s framework and is also easier to learn because it has less base code to implement a simple web-Application. A Web-Application Framework or Web Framework is the collection of modules and libraries that helps the developer to write applications without writing the low-level codes such as protocols, thread management, etc. Flask is based on WSGI(Web Server Gateway Interface) toolkit and Jinja2 template engine.
<br>
The Flask application is started by calling the run() function. The method should be restarted manually for any change in the code. To overcome this, the debug support is enabled so as to track any error.
<br>Routing
Nowadays, the web frameworks provide routing technique so that user can remember the URLs. It is useful to access the web page directly without navigating from the Home page. It is done through the following route() decorator, to bind the URL to a function.
<br>
Flask support various HTTP protocols for data retrieval from the specified URL, these can be defined as:-
<br>
Method      Description<br>
GET	      This is used to send the data in an without encryption of the form to the server.<br>
HEAD	      provides response body to the form<br>
POST	      Sends the form data to server. Data received by POST method is not cached by server.<br>
PUT	      Replaces current representation of target resource with URL.<br>
DELETE	   Deletes the target resource of a given URL<br>
### Session
In Session, the data is stored on Server. It can be defined as a time interval in which the client logs into a server until the user logs out. The data in between them are held in a temporary folder on the Server. Each user is assigned with a specific Session ID. The Session object is a dictionary that contains the key-value pair of the variables associated with the session. A SECRET_KEY is used to store the encrypted data on the cookie.
<h5>File-uploading</h5>
File Uploading in Flask is very easy. It needs an HTML form with enctype attribute and URL handler, that fetches file and saves the object to the desired location. Files are temporary stored on server and then on the desired location.

## Heroku
Heroku is a cloud-based platform. It offers a Platform as a service (PaaS) product. Heroku is based on AWS and its services are simpler to use than Elastic Compute Cloud. It supports efficient building, deploying, and fast scaling. It is popular for its add-on capabilities as it supports many alerts and management tools. The services which are popular for Heroku are it helps you to create run-time applications without taking care of its infrastructure which is internally managed by the tool itself. Following are some reasons for using Heroku :
<br>It gives a scalable platform to deploy products over the cloud without taking care of infrastructure.
